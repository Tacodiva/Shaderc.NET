# Shaderc.NET

This is a fork of [shaderc.net](https://github.com/jpbruyere/shaderc.net) for my game engine.

Here's some of the things I changed:
 - Capitalized a lot of stuff.
 - Made it build for net 7.0.
 - Added Span methods to `Result`.
 - Renamed things to be less generic (like `Compiler` is now `ShaderCompiler` and `Result` is now `ShaderCompilationResult`).
 - Removed a lot of the build stuff.
